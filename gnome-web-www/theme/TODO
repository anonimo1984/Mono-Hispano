These are the pending tasks specifically for the GNOME.org WordPress theme:


Home page
---------

- The introduction area of home page needs sane text
- The home page needs a widget displaying future events (fetching calendar
  information from some other service, maybe?)
- Create a link for "more news" by the end of the news list


News
----

- Import all the old news
- Create a proper specific page for displaying archive posts
- Post sidebar needs content
- Make sure there is RSS support for news


Projects
--------

- Create a nice index of projects like the mockup in src/projects.png
- Projects should have space for a good description, cool screenshots and
  user ratings
- For each project, support indexing:
    - commits
    - releases
    - translations
    - screenshots
    - mailing list
